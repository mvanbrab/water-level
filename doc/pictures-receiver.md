**Many thanks to my friend and colleague Dylan who was so kind to mill
this printed circuit board, as he did for the transmitter earlier!**

Note that on the ESP32-DevKitC V4 capacitor C15 was removed, as
[documented here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/get-started/get-started-devkitc.html#note-on-c15).

Wires connected and operational.
Note the processor board receives power from USB here, so J2 is not connected.
