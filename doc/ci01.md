# Current issue: condensation on the sensor

## The problem

In november 2020 the measurement suddenly became unstable.

I had a look at the sensor and apparently there was so much condensation,
that some big drops of water where hanging at the bottom (active side) of the sensor.

Drying the sensor made the measurement stable again.

However, this is not a solution.

Some modification will be needed.

## The solution

Currently, the following solution is working well and I'll evaluate further during winter.

The sensor was rotated 90 degrees, so that any condensation can drip off.
A reflection plate placed at 45 degrees ensures that the ultrasonic wave propagates in the correct direction.

As you can see, the mechanical setup reuses the original sensor mount.
